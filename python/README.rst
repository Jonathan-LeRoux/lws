Installation
------------

1. The easiest way to install `lws` is via `pip`:  

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install lws

2. To compile from source using cython (required if one modifies the code):  

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd python
            LWS_USE_CYTHON=1 make 

3. To compile from source using the pre-generated c source file (which was obtained with cython): 

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd python
            make

4. Alternatively, one can first use cython to create a tarball, which can then be installed by pip:  

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd python
            make sdist
            pip install dist/lws-1.2.tar.gz

**Note:** On Windows, the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for your version of Python needs to be installed. See `this page<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_ for more details.

Usage
-----
.. code:: python

    import lws
    import numpy as np
    
    lws_processor=lws.lws(512,128, mode="speech") # 512: window length; 128: window shift
    X = lws_processor.stft(x) # where x is a single-channel waveform
    X0 = np.abs(X) # Magnitude spectrogram
    print('{:6}: {:5.2f} dB'.format('Abs(X)', lws_processor.get_consistency(X0))
    X1 = lws_processor.run_lws(X0) # reconstruction from magnitude (in general, one can reconstruct from an initial complex spectrogram)
    print('{:6}: {:5.2f} dB'.format('LWS', lws_processor.get_consistency(X1)))

Options
-------

.. code:: python

    lws_processor=lws.lws(awin_or_fsize, fshift, L = 5, swin = None, look_ahead = 3,
              nofuture_iterations = 0, nofuture_alpha = 1, nofuture_beta = 0.1, nofuture_gamma = 1,
              online_iterations = 0, online_alpha = 1, online_beta = 0.1, online_gamma = 1,
              batch_iterations = 100, batch_alpha = 100, batch_beta = 0.1, batch_gamma = 1,
              symmetric_win = True, mode= None, fftsize=None, perfectrec=True)

* ``awin_or_fsize``: either the analysis window, or a window length (in which case the sqrt(hann) window is used); the analysis window should be symmetric for the computations to be correct.
* ``fshift``: window shift
* ``L``: approximation order in the phase reconstruction algorithm, 5 should be good.
* ``swin``: synthesis window (if None, it gets computed from the analysis window for perfect reconstruction)
* ``look_ahead``: number of look-ahead frames in RTISI-LA-like algorithm, 3 should be good.
* ``xxx_iterations``, ``xxx_alpha``, ``xxx_beta``, ``xxx_gamma``: number of iterations of algorithm xxx (where xxx is one of ``nofuture``, ``online``, or ``batch``), and parameters alpha/beta/gamma of the decreasing sparsity curve that is used to determine which bins get updated at each iteration. Any bin with magnitude larger than a given threshold is updated, others are ignored (``thresholds = alpha * np.exp(- beta * np.arange(iterations)**gamma)``)
* ``symmetric_win``: determines whether to use a symmetric hann window or not
* ``mode``: ``None``, ``'speech'``, or ``'music'``. This sets default numbers of iterations of each algorithm that seem to be good for speech and music signals. Disclaimer: your mileage may vary.
* ``fftsize``: can be set longer than frame size to do 0-padding in the FFT. Note that 0-padding will be done symmetrically on the left and right of the window to enforce symmetry in the analysis window.
* ``perfectrec``: whether to pad with zeros on each side to ensure perfect reconstruction at the boundaries too. 

Three steps are implemented, and they can be turned on/off independently by appropriately setting the corresponding number of iterations:

* "no future" LWS: phase initialization using LWS updates that only involve past frames
* online LWS: phase estimation using online LWS updates, corresponding to a fast time-frequency domain version of RTISI-LA
* LWS: phase estimation using batch LWS updates on the whole spectrogram


Remarks
-------

1) The .cpp files are actually C code with some C99 style comments, but the .cpp extension is needed on Windows for mex to acknowledge the c99 flag (with .c, it is discarded, and -ansi used instead, leading to compilation errors)

2) Because the module is a C extension, it cannot be reloaded (see <http://bugs.python.org/issue1144263>). In Jupyter Notebooks, in particular, autoreload will not work, and the kernel has to be restarted.
